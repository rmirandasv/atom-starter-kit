## üé® Easy Customization

### CSS Variables System
The starter kit is built with **Tailwind CSS 4** and uses a comprehensive CSS variables system in `resources/css/app.css`. All components automatically adapt to your custom theme by simply modifying the CSS variables.

**Key customization points:**
- **Colors**: Primary, secondary, accent, destructive, and chart colors
- **Sidebar**: Dedicated sidebar theming variables
- **Border radius**: Consistent border radius system
- **Dark mode**: Complete dark theme support

### Visual Theme Editor
I recommend using **[TweakCN Theme Editor](https://tweakcn.com/editor/theme)** for easy visual customization:

1. Visit the theme editor to customize your design visually
2. Export the generated CSS variables
3. Replace the variables in `resources/css/app.css`
4. All components will automatically update to match your new theme

### Component System
All UI components in `resources/ts/components/ui/` are built with Shadcn UI and are fully customizable. They automatically inherit your CSS variables, so theme changes are applied consistently across the entire application.
